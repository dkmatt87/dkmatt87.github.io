    Quick Hummus recipe
</h1>

<p>
    This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that
    I have read over the years.
</p>

<p>
    <strong> Hummus </strong> is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.

    <dt><h3>Ingredients</h3></dt>

    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li> <em> 1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</em></li>
            <li> <em> 175g of tahini</em></li>
            <li> <em> 6 sundried tomatoes</em></li>
            <li> <em> Half a red pepper</em></li>
            <li> <em> A pinch of cayenne pepper</em></li>
            <li> <em> 1 clove of garlic</em></li>
            <li> <em> A dash of olive oil</em></li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt><h3>Instructions</h3></dt>

    <dd>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</em></li>
            <li><em>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</em></li>
            <li><em>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</em></li>
            <li><em>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</em></li>
            <li><em>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</em></li>
            <li><em>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</em></li>
        </ol>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
</p>

<h3>
    Storage
</h3>

<p>
    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
</p>

<p>
    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
